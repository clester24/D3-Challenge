# D3-Challenge

1. More Data, More Dynamics
You're going to include more demographics and more risk factors. Place additional labels in your scatter plot and give them click events so that your users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for your circles' locations as well as the range of your axes. Do this for two risk factors for each axis. Or, for an extreme challenge, create three for each axis.

Hint: Try binding all of the CSV data to your circles. This will let you easily determine their x or y values when you click the labels.


2. Incorporate d3-tip
While the ticks on the axes allow us to infer approximate values for each circle, it's impossible to determine the true value without adding another layer of data. Enter tooltips: developers can implement these in their D3 graphics to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element. Add tooltips to your circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. Use the d3-tip.js plugin developed by Justin Palmerâ€”we've already included this plugin in your assignment directory.


Check out David Gotz's example to see how you should implement tooltips with d3-tip.



Assessment
Your final product will be assessed on the following metrics:


Creation of a new repository on GitHub called D3-Challenge (note the kebab-case). Do not add to an already existing repo.


Completion of all steps in the core assignment


Coherency of scatter plot (labels, ticks)


Visual attraction


Professionalism


Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file


Good luck!
